# ngx-sticky-plus

An Angular 2+ directive that emits an event when an element that has `position: sticky` became sticky and optionally adds a CSS class. This enables developers to add special styling e.g a box-shadow when element becomes sticky. Described functionality is currently not supported natively by browsers.

## Features

- ü¶à Very performant (using IntersectionObserver instead of scroll event)
- üêë Supports top / bottom stickyness
- üêß Supports sticky elements within scroll containers

## Getting Started

Install the package with npm

```
npm install ngx-sticky-plus
```

or use yarn

```
yarn add ngx-sticky-plus
```

then add the lib module to your app or feature module:

```typescript
import { NgxStickyPlusModule } from "ngx-sticky-plus";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [],
  imports: [NgxStickyPlusModule],
  providers: [],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now you can use the directive inside your templates:

```html
<header style="position: sticky; top: 0" (stuck)="someFn($event)"></header>
```

- [ ] Support Angular Universal
- [ ] Have decent test coverage
